 * When the payload is present the parameter \a operation MUST point to a
 * \a TEEC_Operation structure populated by the Client Application.
 * If \a operation is NULL then no parameters are exchanged with the
 * Trusted Application, and only the Command ID is exchanged.
 *
 * The \a operation structure is also used to manage cancellation of the
 * Command. If cancellation is required then \a the operation pointer MUST be
 * \a non-NULL and the Client Application MUST have zeroed the \a started
 * field of the \a operation structure before calling this function.
 * The \a operation structure MAY contain no Parameters if no data payload
 * is to be exchanged.
 *
 * The Operation Payload is handled as described by the following steps,
 * which are executed sequentially:
 * 1. Each Parameter in the Operation Payload is examined.
 * If the parameter is a Temporary Memory Reference, then it is registered
 * for the duration of the Operation in accordance with the fields set in
 * the \a TEEC_TempMemoryReference structure and the data flow direction
 * specified in the parameter type. Refer to the \a TEEC_RegisterSharedMemory
 * function for error conditions which can be triggered during
 * temporary registration of a memory region.
 * 2. The contents of all the Memory Regions which are exchanged
 * with the TEE are synchronized
 * 3. The fields of all Value Parameters tagged as input are read by the
 * Implementation. This applies to Parameters of type \a TEEC_VALUE_INPUT or
 * \a TEEC_VALUE_INOUT.
 * 4. The Operation is issued to the Trusted Application.
 * During the execution of the Command, the Trusted Application may read
 * the data held within the memory referred to by input Memory References.
 * It may also write data in to the memory referred to by
 * output Memory References, but these modifications are not guaranteed
 * to be observable by the Client Application until the command completes.
 * 5. After the Command has completed, the Implementation MUST update the
 * \a size field of the Memory Reference structures flagged as output:
 *
 * a. For Memory References that are non-null and marked as output,
 * the updated size field MAY be less than or equal to original size field.
 * In this case this indicates the number of bytes actually written by the
 * Trusted Application, and the Implementation MUST synchronize this region
 * with the Client Application memory space.
 * b. For all Memory References marked as output, the updated size
 * field MAY be larger than the original size field.
 * For null Memory References, a required buffer size MAY be specified by
 * the Trusted Application. In these cases the passed output buffer was
 * too small or absent, and the returned size indicates the size of the
 * output buffer which is necessary for the operation to succeed.
 * In these cases the Implementation SHOULD NOT synchronize any
 * shared data with the Client Application.\n
 *
 * 6. When the Command completes, the Implementation MUST update the fields
 * of all Value Parameters tagged as output,
 * i.e., of type \a TEEC_VALUE_OUTPUT or \a TEEC_VALUE_INOUT.
 * 7. All memory regions that were temporarily registered at the
 * beginning of the function are deregistered as if the function
 * \a TEEC_ReleaseSharedMemory was called on each of them.
 * 8. Control is passed back to the calling Client Application code.
 * \b Programmer \b Error \n.
 *
 * The result of this function is returned both in the function
 * \a TEEC_Result return code and the return origin, stored in the
 * variable pointed to by \a returnOrigin:
 *       If the return origin is different from \a TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP,
 * then the return code MUST be one of the error codes.
 * If the return code is TEEC_ERROR_CANCEL then it means that the operation
 * was cancelled before it reached the Trusted Application.
 * If the return origin is \a TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP, then the
 * meaning of the return code is determined by the protocol exposed by the
 * Trusted Application. It is recommended that the Trusted Application
 * developer chooses TEEC_SUCCESS (0) to indicate success in their protocol,
